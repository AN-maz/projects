# ðŸš€ Projects

This repository collects my projects, ranging from small exercises to bigger applications.  
Each project represents a step in my learning process, where I apply the concepts Iâ€™ve studied into practical work.  
Some projects may have their own dedicated repositories, and this repo serves as a hub to organize them.

## ðŸ”— Notes
Some projects might be moved into their own repositories later, especially if they grow bigger.  
This repository is intended as a showcase of my coding journey and creativity.
